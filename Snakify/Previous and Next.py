#Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the examples below for the exact format your answers should take. There shouldn't be a space before the period.
#Remember that you can convert the numbers to strings using the function str.

number = int(input("What integer do you have? "))

print("The next number for the number", number, "is", str(number + 1) + ".")
print("The previous number for the number", number, "is", str(number - 1) + ".")
